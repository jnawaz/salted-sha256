# salt-sha256

## Inspiration ##

I first used [ salted-sha256 ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/salted-sha256) in a project however the order in which the salt & the data string is hashed wasn't conducive to the format I required and the original repo no longer exists to make a PR.

It was hashing 
```
salt + data
```
however I required

```
data + salt
```

in order to meet the SHA256 of [ this ](https://www.symbionts.de/tools/hash/sha256-hash-salt-generator.html) tool.

This makes it easier to test and verify.
## Installation ##
```
npm i salt-sha256
```

## Usage
```
/ Get salted SHA256.
const saltedHash = saltedSha256('Some data.', 'SUPER-S@LT!');
// Value of "saltedHash": "70dc46430221cdfaddd554e7d1c12d474a2c98e8eaf6ea24d08b1185be1a78d0".
 
// Get salted SHA256 async (as promise). Just set "isAsync" param as "true".
const saltedHashAsync = await saltedSha256('Some data.', 'SUPER-S@LT!', true);
// Value of "saltedHashAsync": "70dc46430221cdfaddd554e7d1c12d474a2c98e8eaf6ea24d08b1185be1a78d0".
